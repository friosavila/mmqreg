abstract = {We study the conditions under which it is possible to estimate regression quantiles by estimating conditional means. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the use of methods that are only valid in the estimation of conditional means, while still providing information on how the regressors affect the entire conditional distribution. The methods we propose are not meant to replace the well-established quantile regression estimator, but provide an additional tool that can allow the estimation of regression quantiles in settings where otherwise that would be difficult or even impossible. We consider two settings in which our approach can be particularly useful: panel data models with individual effects and models with endogenous explanatory variables. Besides presenting the estimator and establishing the regularity conditions needed for valid inference, we perform a small simulation experiment, present two simple illustrative applications, and discuss possible extensions.}

abstract = { Conventional regression techniques focus on the conditional averages, but often of more interest are lower or upper conditional quantiles. A more informative description of the relationship among variables can be obtained through regression quantiles (RQ). The percentile curves are usually computed one level at a time. Associated with great flexibility is the embarrassing phenomenon of quantile crossing. We propose a restricted version of regression quantiles (RRQ) that avoids the occurrence of crossing while maintaining sufficient modeling flexibility. RRQ remains in the general framework of the regression quantiles both conceptually and computationally. Because it relates all quantile functions through the conditional median, it also means substantial savings in computation costs when multiple quantiles for high-dimensional data are needed. Two examples in connection with the physical and engineering sciences are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of RRQ curves. }

 abstract = {A simple minimization problem yielding the ordinary sample quantiles in the location model is shown to generalize naturally to the linear model generating a new class of statistics we term "regression quantiles." The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.},

abstract = {The penalized least squares interpretation of the classical random effects estimator suggests a possible way forward for quantile regression models with a large number of “fixed effects”. The introduction of a large number of individual fixed effects can significantly inflate the variability of estimates of other covariate effects. Regularization, or shrinkage of these individual effects toward a common value can help to modify this inflation effect. A general approach to estimating quantile regression models for longitudinal data is proposed employing ℓ1 regularization methods. Sparse linear algebra and interior point methods for solving large linear programs are essential computational tools.}
